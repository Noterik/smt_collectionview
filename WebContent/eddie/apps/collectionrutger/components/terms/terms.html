		<p>
			The Collection Viewer technical demo is part of Noterik's ongoing development work in the EUscreenXL project. The demo has been made in order to test the making of dynamic components that can display video collection in different layouts, including interactive functionalities. Such components are planned to be used on different pages of the upcoming, new EUscreen portal.
